1. matrix transpose

```python
import torch

# 1.matrix transpose
def tmatrix():
    a = torch.rand(2,4)
    print('a =', a)
    b = torch.t(a)
    print('a\'s transpose matrix is\n', b)

if __name__ == '__main__':
    print('1.matrix transpose')
    tmatrix()
```

result:

```python
# 1.matrix transpose
a = tensor([[0.0471, 0.2030, 0.4294, 0.2553],
        [0.0069, 0.1753, 0.1336, 0.5577]])
a's transpose matrix is
 tensor([[0.0471, 0.0069],
        [0.2030, 0.1753],
        [0.4294, 0.1336],
        [0.2553, 0.5577]])
